Question 4 | Helm Management
Task weight: 5%

 

Team Mercury asked you to perform some operations using Helm, all in Namespace mercury:

Delete release internal-issue-report-apiv1
Upgrade release internal-issue-report-apiv2 to any newer version of chart bitnami/nginx available
Install a new release internal-issue-report-apache of chart bitnami/apache. The Deployment should have two replicas, set these via Helm-values during install
There seems to be a broken release, stuck in pending-upgrade state. Find it and delete it
 

Answer:
Helm Chart: Kubernetes YAML template-files combined into a single package, Values allow customisation

Helm Release: Installed instance of a Chart

Helm Values: Allow to customise the YAML template-files in a Chart when creating a Release

 

1.

First we should delete the required release:

➜ helm -n mercury ls
NAME                            NAMESPACE     STATUS          CHART           APP VERSION
internal-issue-report-apiv1     mercury       deployed        nginx-9.5.0     1.21.1     
internal-issue-report-apiv2     mercury       deployed        nginx-9.5.0     1.21.1     
internal-issue-report-app       mercury       deployed        nginx-9.5.0     1.21.1  

➜ helm -n mercury uninstall internal-issue-report-apiv1
release "internal-issue-report-apiv1" uninstalled

➜ helm -n mercury ls
NAME                            NAMESPACE     STATUS          CHART           APP VERSION
internal-issue-report-apiv2     mercury       deployed        nginx-9.5.0     1.21.1     
internal-issue-report-app       mercury       deployed        nginx-9.5.0     1.21.1  
 

2.

Next we need to upgrade a release, for this we could first list the charts of the repo:

➜ helm repo list
NAME    URL                               
bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

➜ helm repo update
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "bitnami" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈

➜ helm search repo nginx
NAME                  CHART VERSION   APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION          
bitnami/nginx         9.5.2           1.21.1          Chart for the nginx server             ...
Here we see that a newer chart version 9.5.2 is available. But the task only requires us to upgrade to any newer chart version available, so we can simply run:

➜ helm -n mercury upgrade internal-issue-report-apiv2 bitnami/nginx
Release "internal-issue-report-apiv2" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!
NAME: internal-issue-report-apiv2
LAST DEPLOYED: Tue Aug 31 17:40:42 2021
NAMESPACE: mercury
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 2
TEST SUITE: None
...

➜ helm -n mercury ls
NAME                            NAMESPACE     STATUS          CHART           APP VERSION
internal-issue-report-apiv2     mercury       deployed        nginx-9.5.2     1.21.1     
internal-issue-report-app       mercury       deployed        nginx-9.5.0     1.21.1 
Looking good!

INFO: Also check out helm rollback for undoing a helm rollout/upgrade

 

3.

Now we're asked to install a new release, with a customised values setting. For this we first list all possible value settings for the chart, we can do this via:

helm show values bitnami/apache # will show a long list of all possible value-settings

helm show values bitnami/apache | yq e # parse yaml and show with colors
Huge list, if we search in it we should find the setting replicaCount: 1 on top level. This means we can run:

➜ helm -n mercury install internal-issue-report-apache bitnami/apache --set replicaCount=2
NAME: internal-issue-report-apache
LAST DEPLOYED: Tue Aug 31 17:57:23 2021
NAMESPACE: mercury
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
...
If we would also need to set a value on a deeper level, for example image.debug, we could run:

helm -n mercury install internal-issue-report-apache bitnami/apache \
  --set replicaCount=2 \
  --set image.debug=true
Install done, let's verify what we did:

➜ helm -n mercury ls
NAME                            NAMESPACE     STATUS          CHART           APP VERSION
internal-issue-report-apache    mercury       deployed        apache-8.6.3    2.4.48
...

➜ k -n mercury get deploy internal-issue-report-apache
NAME                           READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
internal-issue-report-apache   2/2     2            2           96s
We see a healthy deployment with two replicas!

 

4.

By default releases in pending-upgrade state aren't listed, but we can show all to find and delete the broken release:

➜ helm -n mercury ls -a
NAME                            NAMESPACE     STATUS          CHART           APP VERSION
internal-issue-report-apache    mercury       deployed        apache-8.6.3    2.4.48     
internal-issue-report-apiv2     mercury       deployed        nginx-9.5.2     1.21.1     
internal-issue-report-app       mercury       deployed        nginx-9.5.0     1.21.1     
internal-issue-report-daniel    mercury       pending-upgrade nginx-9.5.0     1.21.1 

➜ helm -n mercury uninstall internal-issue-report-daniel
release "internal-issue-report-daniel" uninstalled
Thank you Helm for making our lifes easier! (Till something breaks)
