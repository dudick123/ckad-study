Question 21 | Requests and Limits, ServiceAccount
Task weight: 4%

 

Team Neptune needs 3 Pods of image httpd:2.4-alpine, create a Deployment named neptune-10ab for this. The containers should be named neptune-pod-10ab. Each container should have a memory request of 20Mi and a memory limit of 50Mi.

Team Neptune has its own ServiceAccount neptune-sa-v2 under which the Pods should run. The Deployment should be in Namespace neptune.

 

Answer:
k -n neptune create deployment -h # help
k -n neptune create deploy -h # deploy is short for deployment

# check the export on the very top of this document so we can use $do
k -n neptune create deploy neptune-10ab --image=httpd:2.4-alpine $do > 21.yaml

vim 21.yaml
Now make the required changes using vim:

# 21.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: neptune-10ab
  name: neptune-10ab
  namespace: neptune
spec:
  replicas: 3                   # change
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: neptune-10ab
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: neptune-10ab
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: neptune-sa-v2 # add
      containers:
      - image: httpd:2.4-alpine
        name: neptune-pod-10ab  # change
        resources:              # add
          limits:               # add
            memory: 50Mi        # add
          requests:             # add
            memory: 20Mi        # add
status: {}
If we don't want to write the resources section manually we could run the following command and copy it manually into our yaml file:

k run tmp --image=busybox $do --requests=memory=20Mi --limits=memory=50Mi
Then create the yaml:

k create -f 21.yaml # namespace already set in yaml
To verify all Pods are running we do:

âžœ k -n neptune get pod | grep neptune-10ab
neptune-10ab-7d4b8d45b-4nzj5   1/1     Running            0          57s
neptune-10ab-7d4b8d45b-lzwrf   1/1     Running            0          17s
neptune-10ab-7d4b8d45b-z5hcc   1/1     Running            0          17s
