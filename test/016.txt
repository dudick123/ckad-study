Question 16 | Logging sidecar
Task weight: 6%

 

The Tech Lead of Mercury2D decided its time for more logging, to finally fight all these missing data incidents. There is an existing container named cleaner-con in Deployment cleaner in Namespace mercury. This container mounts a volume and writes logs into a file called cleaner.log.

The yaml for the existing Deployment is available at /opt/course/16/cleaner.yaml. Persist your changes at /opt/course/16/cleaner-new.yaml but also make sure the Deployment is running.

Create a sidecar container named logger-con, image busybox:1.31.0 , which mounts the same volume and writes the content of cleaner.log to stdout, you can use the tail -f command for this. This way it can be picked up by kubectl logs.

Check if the logs of the new container reveal something about the missing data incidents.

 

Answer
cp /opt/course/16/cleaner.yaml /opt/course/16/cleaner-new.yaml
vim /opt/course/16/cleaner-new.yaml
Add a sidecar container which outputs the log file to stdout:

# /opt/course/16/cleaner-new.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: cleaner
  namespace: mercury
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      id: cleaner
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        id: cleaner
    spec:
      volumes:
      - name: logs
        emptyDir: {}
      initContainers:
      - name: init
        image: bash:5.0.11
        command: ['bash', '-c', 'echo init > /var/log/cleaner/cleaner.log']
        volumeMounts:
        - name: logs
          mountPath: /var/log/cleaner
      containers:
      - name: cleaner-con
        image: bash:5.0.11
        args: ['bash', '-c', 'while true; do echo `date`: "remove random file" >> /var/log/cleaner/cleaner.log; sleep 1; done']
        volumeMounts:
        - name: logs
          mountPath: /var/log/cleaner
      - name: logger-con                                                # add
        image: busybox:1.31.0                                           # add
        command: ["sh", "-c", "tail -f /var/log/cleaner/cleaner.log"]   # add
        volumeMounts:                                                   # add
        - name: logs                                                    # add
          mountPath: /var/log/cleaner                                   # add
Then apply the changes and check the logs of the sidecar:

k -f /opt/course/16/cleaner-new.yaml apply
This will cause a deployment rollout of which we can get more details:

k -n mercury rollout history deploy cleaner
k -n mercury rollout history deploy cleaner --revision 1
k -n mercury rollout history deploy cleaner --revision 2
Check Pod statuses:

➜ k -n mercury get pod
NAME                       READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
cleaner-86b7758668-9pw6t   2/2     Running       0          6s
cleaner-86b7758668-qgh4v   0/2     Init:0/1      0          1s

➜ k -n mercury get pod
NAME                       READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
cleaner-86b7758668-9pw6t   2/2     Running       0          14s
cleaner-86b7758668-qgh4v   2/2     Running       0          9s
Finally check the logs of the logging sidecar container:

➜ k -n mercury logs cleaner-576967576c-cqtgx -c logger-con
init
Wed Sep 11 10:45:44 UTC 2099: remove random file
Wed Sep 11 10:45:45 UTC 2099: remove random file
...
Mystery solved, something is removing files at random ;) It's important to understand how containers can communicate with each other using volumes.
