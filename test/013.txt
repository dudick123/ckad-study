Question 13 | Storage, StorageClass, PVC
Task weight: 6%

 

Team Moonpie, which has the Namespace moon, needs more storage. Create a new PersistentVolumeClaim named moon-pvc-126 in that namespace. This claim should use a new StorageClass moon-retain with the provisioner set to moon-retainer and the reclaimPolicy set to Retain. The claim should request storage of 3Gi, an accessMode of ReadWriteOnce and should use the new StorageClass.

The provisioner moon-retainer will be created by another team, so it's expected that the PVC will not boot yet. Confirm this by writing the log message from the PVC into file /opt/course/13/pvc-126-reason.

 

Answer
vim 13_sc.yaml
Head to https://kubernetes.io/docs, search for "storageclass" and alter the example code to this:

# 13_sc.yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: moon-retain
provisioner: moon-retainer
reclaimPolicy: Retain
k create -f 13_sc.yaml
Now the same for the PersistentVolumeClaim, head to the docs, copy an example and transform it into:

vim 13_pvc.yaml
# 13_pvc.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: moon-pvc-126            # name as requested
  namespace: moon               # important
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce             # RWO
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 3Gi              # size
  storageClassName: moon-retain # uses our new storage class
k -f 13_pvc.yaml create
Next we check the status of the PVC :

➜ k -n moon get pvc
NAME           STATUS    VOLUME   CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
moon-pvc-126   Pending                                      moon-retain    2m57s
➜ k -n moon describe pvc moon-pvc-126
Name:          moon-pvc-126
...
Status:        Pending
...
Events:
...
waiting for a volume to be created, either by external provisioner "moon-retainer" or manually created by system administrator
This confirms that the PVC waits for the provisioner moon-retainer to be created. Finally we copy or write the event message into the requested location:

# /opt/course/13/pvc-126-reason
waiting for a volume to be created, either by external provisioner "moon-retainer" or manually created by system administrator
