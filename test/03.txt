Question 3 | Job
Task weight: 2%

 

Team Neptune needs a Job template located at /opt/course/3/job.yaml. This Job should run image busybox:1.31.0 and execute sleep 2 && echo done. It should be in namespace neptune, run a total of 3 times and should execute 2 runs in parallel.

Start the Job and check its history. Each pod created by the Job should have the label id: awesome-job. The job should be named neb-new-job and the container neb-new-job-container.

 

Answer:
k -n neptun create job -h

# check the export on the very top of this document so we can use $do
k -n neptune create job neb-new-job --image=busybox:1.31.0 $do > /opt/course/3/job.yaml -- sh -c "sleep 2 && echo done"

vim /opt/course/3/job.yaml
Make the required changes in the yaml:

# /opt/course/3/job.yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: neb-new-job
  namespace: neptune      # add
spec:
  completions: 3          # add
  parallelism: 2          # add
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:             # add
        id: awesome-job   # add
    spec:
      containers:
      - command:
        - sh
        - -c
        - sleep 2 && echo done
        image: busybox:1.31.0
        name: neb-new-job-container # update
        resources: {}
      restartPolicy: Never
status: {}
Then to create it:

k -f /opt/course/3/job.yaml create # namespace already set in yaml
Check Job and Pods, you should see two running parallel at most but three in total:

➜ k -n neptune get pod,job | grep neb-new-job
pod/neb-new-job-jhq2g              0/1     ContainerCreating   0          4s
pod/neb-new-job-vf6ts              0/1     ContainerCreating   0          4s

job.batch/neb-new-job   0/3           4s         5s


➜ k -n neptune get pod,job | grep neb-new-job
pod/neb-new-job-gm8sz              0/1     ContainerCreating   0          0s

➜ k -n neptune get pod,job | grep neb-new-job
pod/neb-new-job-gm8sz              0/1     ContainerCreating   0          5s

job.batch/neb-new-job   2/3           15s        16s


➜ k -n neptune get pod,job | grep neb-new-job
pod/neb-new-job-gm8sz              0/1     Completed          0          12s

pod/neb-new-job-vf6ts              0/1     Completed          0          22s

job.batch/neb-new-job   3/3           21s        23s
Check history:

➜ k -n neptune describe job neb-new-job
...
Events:
  Type    Reason            Age    From            Message
  ----    ------            ----   ----            -------
  Normal  SuccessfulCreate  2m52s  job-controller  Created pod: neb-new-job-jhq2g
  Normal  SuccessfulCreate  2m52s  job-controller  Created pod: neb-new-job-vf6ts
  Normal  SuccessfulCreate  2m42s  job-controller  Created pod: neb-new-job-gm8sz
At the age column we can see that two pods run parallel and the third one after that. Just as it was required in the task.
